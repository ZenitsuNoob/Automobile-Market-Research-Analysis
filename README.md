🚗 Automobile Market Research Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using Power BI)

📌 Project Objective

The aim of this project is to explore and compare car manufacturers based on the features provided in their different models. By focusing on features most preferred by customers, this project ranks car brands accordingly. The goal is to help people—whether consumers or decision-makers—understand which brands are excelling in meeting feature demands, and to spot patterns in user preferences across the auto industry. 🔍 Scope of Work
